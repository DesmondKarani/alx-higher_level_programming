# 0x11. Python - Network #1

This project, part of the Holberton School curriculum, dives into the basics of networking in Python. Guided by Guillaume, the CTO at Holberton School, students will explore how to work with internet resources using Python. The focus is on utilizing the `urllib` and `requests` packages to fetch and manipulate data from the internet.

## Project Details

- **Duration**: Starts on March 1, 2024, at 6:00 AM and ends on March 2, 2024, at 6:00 AM.
- **Checker Release**: March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM.
- **Auto Review Deadline**: March 2, 2024, at 6:00 AM.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, learners should be able to:

- Fetch internet resources using the `urllib` package.
- Decode the body response of `urllib`.
- Utilize the `requests` package for simpler HTTP operations.
- Make various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
- Fetch and manipulate JSON resources.
- Handle data from external services.

## Requirements

### General

- Use allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- Code should be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Files must end with a newline.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Code should follow the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- Documentation is required for all modules, classes, and methods.
- The script should not execute when imported.

### Technical

- Understand and implement fetching of internet resources with `urllib`.
- Learn the usage and advantages of the `requests` package over `urllib`.
- Practice making HTTP requests and handling responses.
- Manipulate and use data from JSON resources.
